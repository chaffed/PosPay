"""Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit (WSUD) e-signature — a customer-scoped
self-service attestation that one or more of the customer's own consumer-SEC-code ACH
debits, already returned, were unauthorized. See domain/wsud_statement.py.

IMPORTANT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE: CONSENT_DISCLOSURE_TEXT and ATTESTATION_TEXT below are
placeholder legal language implementing the *structural* elements the federal E-SIGN
Act (15 U.S.C. § 7001) requires for consumer e-signatures — a disclosure the consumer
must affirmatively consent to before signing (right to a paper copy, how to withdraw
consent, hardware/software needed), a distinct signing act, and tamper-evident
retention of exactly what was shown and signed. This has not been reviewed by a
lawyer. A bank deploying this should have its own counsel review and, if needed,
replace this text before relying on it."""
