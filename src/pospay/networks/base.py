    new network (e.g. RTP) means writing one of these plus a `register_adapter()` call,
    with no changes to exception_item, decision, ml/, or the /exceptions API.

    `settlement_timing` is the forward-looking hook for real-time/irrevocable networks:
    ASYNC_REVIEWABLE networks (check, ach) create an exception_item and let a human review
    it within a window before final settlement. A SYNCHRONOUS_AUTHORIZATION network (e.g.
    RTP) would need its evaluate() called inline in the submission request path, with the
    ingestion API blocking on the result rather than accepting-and-queuing — that's a
    different call pattern at the ingestion service, not a schema change here.
