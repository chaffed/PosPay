"""Outbound HTTP to addresses an organization's admin typed in (today: the OIDC issuer an
SSO connection points at, and whatever endpoints its discovery document names).

Without this, anyone who can edit an SSO connection can make the PosPay server send
requests into its own network: cloud metadata services (169.254.169.254), databases and
admin consoles on private addresses, or localhost. That's server-side request forgery
(SSRF), and /ui/login/sso/{id}/start is unauthenticated, so once a connection exists anyone
can trigger the fetch.

Two layers:
- check_url(): the URL itself must be https (no embedded credentials) and must not name
  localhost or a non-public IP literal. Used when a connection is saved (a clear form
  error) and before every fetch.
- public_only_client(): an httpx client whose connections resolve the hostname and refuse
  to connect unless EVERY address it resolves to is public, then connect to exactly the
  address that was checked. Checking at connect time, not beforehand, is what defeats DNS
  rebinding (a name that resolves to a public address when checked and a private one when
  used). TLS certificates are still verified against the hostname (httpcore sends the
  original host as SNI). Redirects aren't followed, since every hop would need the same
  checks. The client doesn't use proxy environment variables (httpx ignores them when an
  explicit transport is given), so a deployment that needs an egress proxy to reach its
  identity provider needs a follow-up here.

config.Settings.oidc_allow_private_hosts turns both layers off so a local test identity
provider (http://localhost:8080, a Keycloak container) works. config.assert_production_safe
refuses to start a production deployment with it on."""
