class WsudStatement(Base):
    """A signed Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit — see services/wsud_service.py.
    Always customer-scoped (`customer_id` non-nullable): in PosPay the "customer" is the
    actual account holder, so this is a self-service attestation by that customer's own
    login, never a bank employee signing on their behalf. Covers one or more disputed
    ACH transactions (see WsudStatementTransaction) with a single signature.

    Tamper-evident like the audit log (services/audit_log_service.py) — `signature_hex`
    is an ECDSA-P256/SHA256 signature over this row's own canonical fields, using a key
    pair (`wsud_signing_private_key_path`) dedicated to this artifact type alone, same
    "a leaked key for one signed-artifact type shouldn't compromise another" reasoning
    as the JWT/file-signing/audit-log keys. Unlike the audit log, this is a standalone
    per-document signature, not a hash chain — a WSUD statement doesn't depend on
    "what came before it" the way a sequential action log does.

    `statement_text_snapshot`/`consent_disclosure_version` capture exactly what was
    shown to and signed by this customer at this moment — if the disclosure/attestation
    text is edited later, past signatures still mean exactly what they meant when
    signed, same "snapshot as observed" philosophy as Decision.features_json.

    NOTE: the disclosure/attestation text this signs over (services/wsud_service.py's
    _CONSENT_DISCLOSURE_TEXT/_ATTESTATION_TEXT) is placeholder legal language, not
    reviewed by counsel — see that module's docstring."""
