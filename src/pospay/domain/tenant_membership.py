class TenantMembership(Base):
    """What actually grants a User access to a Tenant, and which SecurityGroup governs
    that access — this is the join that makes cross-tenant identities possible: one User
    row can have a TenantMembership (each with its own security group) in more than one
    Tenant. Deactivating one membership (is_active=False) only removes access to that one
    tenant, not the identity itself or its other memberships.

    `customer_id` (nullable) is what makes a membership customer-scoped instead of
    tenant-wide: NULL means the classic bank-wide membership (unchanged from before
    customers existed); a real value means this membership's security_group only applies
    to that one Customer's data — used identically whether the person is bank staff
    assigned to specific clients or a customer's own employee. One user can now hold
    several memberships in the same tenant (one per customer, or one tenant-wide plus
    per-customer ones), which is why the unique constraint is on the triple rather than
    just (user_id, tenant_id) — see web/routers/tenant_switch.py, which now has to key its
    lookup on this row's own id rather than tenant_id alone.

    Note: standard SQL treats NULL as distinct from NULL for uniqueness purposes, so this
    constraint alone can't stop a user from ending up with two tenant-wide (customer_id
    IS NULL) memberships in the same tenant — that invariant is enforced in
    services/user_service.py before a membership is created, not by the database."""
