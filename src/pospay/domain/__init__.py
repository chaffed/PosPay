# Importing this package must register every ORM mapper, even though most call sites
# only need one or two models directly. SQLAlchemy resolves ForeignKey("table.id")
# strings lazily against whatever's been mapped so far — if a model referenced only by
# FK string (e.g. Account, via issued_item.account_id) was never actually imported
# anywhere in the running process, mapper configuration fails at first flush with
# NoReferencedTableError, even though every individual module imports cleanly on its own.
