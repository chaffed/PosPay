"""Run a scheduled job on at most one app instance at a time.

Every instance that enables a scheduler flag starts its own in-process APScheduler, so two
instances sharing one database would each run every job: two retrains, two dropbox scans
racing to import the same file, two notification sends. On PostgreSQL each job run first
takes a session-level advisory lock keyed on the job's id (`pg_try_advisory_lock`, which
never waits). The instance that gets it runs the job; any other instance skips that tick
and tries again on its next one. Postgres drops the lock automatically if the holder's
connection dies, so a crashed instance can't leave a job stuck.

SQLite and SQL Server have no equivalent here, so on them the job simply runs: those
deployments must stay a single process (see README, "Running more than one instance").
