    address. Behind a reverse proxy/WAF (POSPAY_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT > 0), instead trusts
    exactly that many entries from the *right* end of X-Forwarded-For -- the hop your own
    proxy chain appended, never the client-supplied left end, which is trivially
    spoofable. Leaving this at 0 (the default) never reads the header at all, so a
    missing or misconfigured proxy can't silently start trusting a forged header."""
