"""Keeping a web session alive. Both routes live under /ui/auth because the refresh cookie
is path-scoped there (web/security.py::REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH) — no other route ever sees it.

- POST /ui/auth/refresh: called by static/js/session.js while the user is active (and by
  its "Stay signed in" button), a few minutes before the access token's idle timeout.
- GET /ui/auth/resume?next=...: where web/deps.py::get_web_context sends a page request
  whose access token has expired. If it expired only moments ago (see _IDLE_GRACE), the
  session continues and the user lands on the page they asked for; otherwise they sign in
  again and are then sent there. A GET is safe here: it changes no data, it only reissues
  the caller's own session from a cookie a cross-site request can't read, and `next` is
  restricted to a same-origin path.

The idle timeout is enforced HERE, server-side: the web UI may only continue a session
whose access token hasn't yet expired (give or take _IDLE_GRACE). Without that, a refresh
token alone could revive a session that had sat idle for hours, right up to its maximum
length, and the tenant's idle-timeout setting would mean nothing. (The JSON API keeps
normal OAuth-style refresh semantics: clients refresh after expiry, by design.)"""
