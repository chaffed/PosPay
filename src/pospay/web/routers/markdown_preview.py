    here is exactly what will actually render, not a second, potentially-divergent
    client-side Markdown implementation -- including catching an oversized/invalid
    embedded image before the user even submits the form. No CSRF check: this has no
    side effects at all (never writes anything, purely a stateless render), same
    reasoning a GET would get if the payload weren't too large for a query string. Gated
    by simply being logged in -- rendering arbitrary text to sanitized HTML has no
    authorization concern of its own beyond that -- but that's meaningless for a public
    demo tenant whose credentials are public, hence the extra per-IP rate limit on top of
    the global one every route already gets (main.py): this endpoint runs Pillow
    decode/re-encode per call and has no other cost guard of its own."""
