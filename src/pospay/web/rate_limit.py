"""A small in-memory, per-process sliding-window rate limiter -- hand-rolled rather than
a new dependency, since a distributed/Redis-backed limiter isn't needed for the one
deployment model this repo documents: scripts/launcher.py runs a single uvicorn process
with no workers=N, so per-process in-memory counters are the correct fit here, not a
shortcut. (A future multi-worker production launch would give each worker its own
counters, multiplying the effective limit by worker count -- a deployment-time
consideration, not something this module can fix on its own.)

Used two ways: main.py's global middleware applies one generous default limit to every
request, and individual routes (see markdown_preview.py) can layer a stricter,
route-specific limit on top via the rate_limit() dependency factory below.

Memory is bounded two ways, both handled inline rather than needing a background thread:
an active key's own deque never holds more than `limit` timestamps (expired ones are
trimmed on every call for that key), and a periodic full-dict sweep (RateLimiter._sweep,
triggered every _SWEEP_EVERY_N_CALLS calls) drops keys nobody has hit in a while -- e.g. a
one-off visitor's IP, which would otherwise never get revisited and so never get its own
per-key trim to run again.
