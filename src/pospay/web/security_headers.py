"""Security response headers, applied to every response by main.py's middleware.

Content-Security-Policy is the one that needs real justification, not just a checklist
entry, since this app renders user-authored content (sanitized Markdown banner/message
text — services/message_content.py, web/templates.py::render_markdown): script-src is
kept STRICT ('self' plus a fresh per-request nonce, no 'unsafe-inline') because that's the
one header that would actually stop an injected <script> from executing if a future bug
ever slipped past nh3 sanitization — a real, not theoretical, defense-in-depth layer given
what this app renders. Getting there required a small refactor: this codebase had a
handful of inline <script> blocks (now nonce'd, see login_webauthn.html /
login_webauthn_setup.html / security/webauthn.html) and inline onchange=".../onclick="..."
handlers (now data-auto-submit / data-confirm attributes, wired up in app.js) that a
strict script-src would otherwise have silently broken.

style-src is 'unsafe-inline' rather than nonce'd — a deliberately weaker, pragmatic
tradeoff, not an oversight: a dozen-plus templates use small style="..." attributes for
one-off layout tweaks, and the vendored Mermaid renderer (data-dictionary.html) injects
its own <style> elements at runtime with no nonce support at all, so a strict style-src
would require either rewriting every inline style into a CSS class or serving a different
CSP on that one page. Inline CSS also can't execute script the way inline JS can — the
practical risk 'unsafe-inline' accepts here (CSS-based UI redress / attribute-selector
data leaks) is real but far narrower than what a relaxed script-src would have accepted."""
