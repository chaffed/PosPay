"""One-click local launcher for PosPay (SQLite, zero external services).

Run this directly (`python3 scripts/launcher.py`) or via the platform wrapper
(run_pospay.command on macOS): it creates a virtual environment if needed, installs the
project into it, runs database migrations, prompts for first-run setup info if the
database is empty, then starts the server and opens your browser.

Everything this script creates — the virtual environment, the SQLite database, uploaded
check images, and trained ML model files — lives under .pospay-run/ next to this project,
never inside the source tree itself. To fully reset (wipe the database, uploads, trained
models, and installed dependencies) and start over, just delete that one folder:

    rm -rf .pospay-run

Safe to re-run any time otherwise — every step is idempotent and skips whatever's
already done.

Deliberately stdlib-only until AFTER the re-exec into the venv's own interpreter (see
_create_venv_and_install/_reexec_under_venv below): this script must run under whatever
bare Python the user has, before any of PosPay's dependencies exist anywhere.
