# Production image. See Dockerfile.demo for the public-demo variant, which builds on top
# of this image rather than duplicating it (see that file). Runs with
# POSPAY_ENVIRONMENT=production baked in (config.py::assert_production_safe) -- a
# deployment that forgets to supply real signing keys / POSPAY_SSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY / WSUD
# text refuses to start with a clear error instead of silently serving with the
# checked-in dev/test defaults every clone of this repo shares. See README.md's "Docker"
# section for the full list of what must be supplied at deploy time, and its "Reverse
# proxy / WAF deployment" section for why this must stay a single instance -- web/
# rate_limit.py's per-IP limiter and services/demo_tenant_service.py's idle-reset
# tracking are both in-process state, not shared across replicas.
