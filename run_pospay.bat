rem can be Microsoft Store's app-execution-alias stub (which does nothing but open the
rem Store) rather than an actual interpreter. Each command line here is its own
rem top-level statement (not inside a parenthesized block), so plain %ERRORLEVEL%
rem expansion below reflects that line's own exit code, not a value frozen at parse time.
