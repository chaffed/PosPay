# PosPay architecture

How PosPay is put together, and why. It's written for engineers changing the code. For
setup and deployment see [README.md](../README.md), for the JSON API see
[API.md](../API.md), and for onboarding a bank or customer see
[RUNBOOK.md](../RUNBOOK.md).

Paths below are relative to `src/pospay/` unless they start with `tests/`, `migrations/`
or `docs/`.

## The big picture

Positive pay: a bank's business customer tells the bank which checks it wrote (issued
items) and which ACH debits it expects (authorization rules). When a check is presented
or an ACH debit arrives, PosPay compares it with what the customer said. If it matches,
it clears. If it doesn't, PosPay raises an **exception**, and a person decides whether to
pay or return it before the settlement deadline.

```

                                   decision (pay / return) ──► ML training data
```

Every decision a person makes becomes a labelled training example, so the fraud-risk
score improves as a bank uses the product.

## Tenancy: banks, customers, and isolation

A **tenant** is a bank. A **customer** is one of the bank's business clients
(`domain/customer.py`). A **user** is a global login identity (`domain/user.py`), and a
**tenant membership** (`domain/tenant_membership.py`) attaches a user to one bank with a
security group and, optionally, a `customer_id`. A membership with a `customer_id` is
**customer-scoped**: that user sees only that customer's data. One person can belong to
several banks, with a separate membership in each.

Isolation has three layers:

1. **Repository filter (the one that matters).** `repositories/base.py::TenantScopedRepository`
   adds `WHERE tenant_id = :tenant` to every read and stamps `tenant_id` on every insert.
   `CustomerScopedRepository` also filters on `customer_id` when the caller is
   customer-scoped. The tenant id always comes from the authenticated token
   (`db/tenancy.py::TenantContext`, built in `auth/deps.py` or `web/deps.py`), never from a
   request body or path. `tests/test_api/test_cross_tenant_isolation.py` attacks every
   endpoint with another tenant's ids to prove this layer holds.
2. **Permission masking.** A customer-scoped membership can't hold tenant-wide
   permissions even if its security group grants them (`auth/deps.py`).
3. **Postgres row-level security (defence in depth).** Migration
   `6b9b23b81e31_postgres_row_level_security_defense_in_` forces RLS on the single-tenant
   operational tables. It's a no-op on SQLite and SQL Server. `exception_item` and
   `decision` are left out on purpose: training the shared ML model reads decisions from
   every bank that chose it (see [ML pipeline](#ml-pipeline)). If you need RLS there too,
   give the training job its own `BYPASSRLS` role rather than weakening the policy.

Customer-owned rows (`account`, `issued_item`, `paid_item`, `exception_item`, and so on)
carry a **denormalized `customer_id`** copied from their account at creation time. That
makes the customer filter a single-column `WHERE` rather than a join, and it's also what
per-customer ML training groups on.

The **platform operator** (whoever runs the PosPay installation) is not a tenant. They act
through platform API keys (`domain/platform_api_key.py`, `auth/platform_api_key_deps.py`)
with explicit scopes, for example running the shared ML model (`api/v1/platform_ml.py`)
or reading usage metrics.

## Data model

The core tables, by area:

- **Check:** `issued_item` (what the customer wrote), `stop_payment`, `paid_item` (what
  was presented), `check_image` (front/back images, OCR results).
- **ACH:** `ach_authorization_rule` (which originators may debit an account, with
  optional receiver, amount, frequency and SEC-code limits), `ach_transaction`,
  `ach_return_reason`, and `wsud_statement` for Written Statements of Unauthorized Debit.
- **Shared review core:** `exception_item` and `decision`. These are network-agnostic.
- **ML:** `ml_model` (one row per trained version, in a *slot*), `customer_ml_setting`.
- **Organisation:** `tenant`, `customer`, `user`, `tenant_membership`, `security_group`,
  `sso_connection`, `webauthn_credential`.
- **Operations:** `audit_log_entry` (append-only), `bulk_upload_file` and
  `bulk_upload_created_record` (so a bulk upload can be backed out), `notification`,
  `data_export_job`, `revoked_session`.

### Why `exception_item.source_item_id` has no foreign key

An exception can come from any network: a `paid_item` for checks, an `ach_transaction`
for ACH, and later perhaps an RTP payment. A typed foreign key per network would mean a new
nullable column (and a migration) on the shared table for every network. Instead,
`source_item_id` is a plain UUID plus `network_code`, and the only sanctioned way to
dereference it is `networks.registry.get_adapter(network_code).load_source_item(...)`.
The cost is that the database can't enforce the pointer, so
`tests/test_api/test_exception_pointer_integrity.py` checks it instead.
`related_reference_id` (the matched issued item or authorization rule) follows the same
pattern.

### Enums

Enums are stored with `native_enum=False`, so they're portable VARCHAR columns across
SQLite, Postgres and SQL Server. SQLAlchemy stores the member **name**, uppercase, not the
value. Keep that in mind when writing data migrations or raw SQL.

## Payment networks: the adapter pattern

Each network is a package under `networks/` (`check/`, `ach/`) that implements
`networks/base.py::NetworkAdapter` and registers itself with
`networks.registry.register_adapter()`:

| Method | Does |
|--------|------|
| `evaluate(session, transaction)` | Runs the network's matching rules and returns a `MatchResult` |
| `build_features(session, exception_item)` | Builds that network's ML feature dict |
| `load_source_item(session, source_item_id)` | Resolves `exception_item.source_item_id` |

Shared code (`services/exception_service.py`, `ml/predict.py`,
`api/v1/exceptions.py`, `api/v1/decisions.py`) only talks to the registry, never to a
concrete network. Adding a network means a new `networks/<code>/` package, a
`payment_network` row, and one import in `main.py`. It doesn't touch `exception_item`,
`decision`, `ml/` or the exceptions API.

`settlement_timing` is the hook for real-time networks. Check and ACH are
`ASYNC_REVIEWABLE`: accept the item, raise an exception, and let a person review it before
settlement. A `SYNCHRONOUS_AUTHORIZATION` network such as RTP would need `evaluate()`
called inline, with the ingestion request blocking on the answer. That's a different call
pattern in the ingestion service, not a schema change.

Each package typically has `types.py` (inputs/enums), `rules.py` (pure rule function),
`adapter.py` (loads the facts from the database and calls the rules), `ingestion.py`
(creates the transaction and the exception), `features.py` and `bulk_import.py`.

## Matching rules

Rules are **pure functions**: `networks/check/rules.py::evaluate_check_rules` and
`networks/ach/rules.py::evaluate_ach_rules` take a snapshot of pre-loaded facts and return
`(exception_types, related_reference_id)`. The adapter does all the database work. That
keeps the rules trivially unit-testable and makes their order easy to read.

### Check rules, in order

1. **Duplicate paid**: another item with the same account, check number and amount has
   already been paid. It's recorded, but checking continues, so the reviewer also sees
   *why else* the item might be wrong.
2. **Stop payment**: an active stop matches. **Stops here.** A stopped check is returned
   whatever else is true, so further findings would just be noise.
3. **Not in file**: no issued item with this account and check number. **Stops here**,
   because every remaining rule compares against the issued item.
4. **Voided**: the issued item was voided.
5. **Amount mismatch**: the presented amount differs from the issued amount (exact
   comparison).
6. **Payee mismatch**: only when OCR produced a payee. A fuzzy `token_set_ratio` on
   normalised names below `payee_match_fuzzy_threshold`. Without OCR, this rule can't fire.
7. **Stale dated**: presented more than the bank's `stale_date_threshold_days` after
   issue.

Rules 4–7 accumulate, so one item can carry several reasons ("Amount mismatch, Stale
dated").

### ACH rules, in order

Only **debits** are checked, since ACH positive pay is about money leaving the account.
Credits always clear.

1. The account blocks all debits → **unauthorized originator**.
2. No authorization rule for this originator → **unauthorized originator**.
3. Choose the rule: an exact `receiver_id` match beats a wildcard rule (`receiver_id` is
   null). That lets a customer allow a company in general but tighten limits for one
   receiver. If the originator has rules but none covers this receiver → **receiver ID
   not permitted**, a different signal for the reviewer from "never heard of them".
4. Against the chosen rule, accumulating: **amount exceeds limit**, **frequency exceeded**
   (prior debits in the period ≥ the limit), **SEC code not permitted**.

An exception can be turned into an allow-list rule from its detail page, so the same
pattern clears next time.

## From exception to decision

When a rule fires, ingestion (`networks/<code>/ingestion.py`):

1. creates the `exception_item` with its reasons and a **decision deadline** when the
   customer has a default disposition (`services/auto_disposition_service.py`);
2. scores it (`ml/predict.py::score_exception`; see below);
3. queues notifications (`services/notification_service.py`).

A person then decides, through `services/decision_service.py`:

- **Single control:** one user with the decide permission records pay or return.
- **Dual control** (maker/checker, per bank): one user *recommends*
  (`submit_recommendation`, status `pending_approval`) and a **different** user
  approves or rejects it (`decide`). The service enforces maker ≠ checker.

`decide()` is the ML feedback point. It snapshots the exception's current feature vector
into `decision.features_json`, so later training uses the facts as they were when the
decision was made.

If nobody decides by the deadline, the scheduled sweep
(`workers/tasks.py::sweep_expired_dispositions_job`) applies the customer's default: always
pay, always return, or follow the model's score. It leaves the item alone if the choice
can't be made safely (no model yet, or an ACH return with no default return reason).

Evidence for a decision (images, OCR, matched issued item, rule details) is assembled by
`services/exception_evidence.py`. Recommendations, decisions and other significant actions
are written to the append-only audit log (`services/audit_log_service.py`).

## ML pipeline

### What the score means

`exception_item.ml_score` is the model's probability that the item should be **paid**. The
UI shows the inverse as "Fraud risk" (low/medium/high). No model means no score, never a
made-up 0.5, so the UI can tell "unknown" from "uncertain".

### Model choice

The model is **logistic regression** over a `DictVectorizer` (`ml/model.py`). That's
deliberate: in a fraud-adjacent product, "why was this flagged?" needs an answer a
coefficient can give. Anything else can sit behind the same `ScoringModel` protocol later.

There's **one model per network**. Check and ACH exceptions have different facts (payee
similarity and OCR confidence against SEC codes and receiver IDs), so each network's
`features.py` builds its own feature shape. A single combined model would be mostly
zero-filled columns.

### Slots: shared, bank-only, customer

`ml/registry.py` keeps models in **slots**. Each slot has at most one `active` model plus
its history:

| Slot | Trained on | Run by |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Shared (per network) | Decisions from every bank that chose the shared model. A bank's fraud-training examples count only once the platform operator approves them. | Platform operator (`/api/v1/platform/ml/*`) |
| Bank-only | That bank's own decisions, including its fraud-training examples | The bank's admins |
| Customer | That customer's decisions | The bank's admins |

Each bank chooses the shared or bank-only model (`tenant.ml_model_source`,
`services/tenant_ml_service.py`). New banks start on the shared model, which solves the
cold-start problem: a new bank gets useful scores on day one. A new bank can't switch to a bank-only
model for its first 90 days (`ml_new_bank_private_switch_lock_days`); the platform
operator can lift that early. When a bank does switch, the shared model is **copied** into
its bank-only slot, so it keeps scoring while it builds up its own data, and its decisions
stop feeding the shared model. Switching back is never locked, but the bank must
acknowledge the data-pooling disclosure first.

Which model scores an exception (`ml/predict.py::_resolve_scoring_source`):

1. A customer's exception uses that customer's own model if it has an active one and its
   setting isn't "Bank's model" (`customer_ml_setting`, default AUTO).
2. Otherwise, the bank's choice: bank-only or shared.

### Training and promotion

`workers/tasks.py::retrain_job` walks every slot that has enough new labelled decisions
and calls `ml/train.py::train_model`. Training holds out the most recent decisions. The
new model (challenger) and the active one (champion) are scored on the **same** holdout,
and the challenger is promoted only if it does at least as well
(`_promotion_decision`). A bank's first model trained on its own data must also have seen
at least `ml_bank_model_min_decisions`, so it can't beat the seeded copy by luck on a tiny
sample. There's a per-slot cooldown so on-demand retraining can't be used to burn compute.

Artifacts are joblib (pickle) files under `ml_artifact_dir` (`ml/registry.py::ArtifactStore`).
The database holds each file's path and its SHA-256 (`ml_model.artifact_sha256`), and a
file is unpickled only if it still matches, because unpickling a swapped file would run
code. A model that fails the check simply doesn't score, and the failure is logged. `ml/predict.py` caches loaded models per slot and reloads
automatically when the slot's active model id changes.

## OCR

`ocr/base.py` defines the `OCRProvider` protocol, and `ocr/factory.py` picks the provider
from config. The default, `ocr/tesseract_provider.py`, is local and needs no cloud
account, but it's a general-purpose engine: it finds the amount and payee with regular
expressions after preprocessing (`ocr/preprocessing.py`). It's fine for trials and printed
checks, but not accurate enough for high-volume handwritten checks. That's the OCR risk,
and it's why the provider is swappable. AWS Textract and Azure Document Intelligence
(`textract_provider.py`, `azure_di_provider.py`) are **stubs**, and startup refuses to run
with them configured.

OCR runs as a background task after an image upload
(`networks/check/ocr_processing.py`). A failure or timeout marks the image as failed, but
never blocks the paid item. Only the payee rule uses OCR output.

## Bulk ingestion

Files arrive through the UI, the API, or a watched **dropbox** directory
(`services/dropbox_import_service.py`, run by `dropbox_import_job`). Parsers live in
`bulk_import/` (CSV, NACHA, X9.37, ZIP of images + CSV).

- **Parsing is all-or-nothing.** A file that can't be parsed, or whose control totals don't
  add up (NACHA batch/file controls; X9.37 bundle, cash-letter and file controls), is
  rejected before anything is written.
- **Ingestion commits row by row** (`ingest_paid_items_bulk` and friends). One bad row (an
  unknown account, a duplicate) fails on its own, and the rest of the file still loads. The
  per-row results are shown to the uploader.
- Every row created is recorded in `bulk_upload_created_record`, so the whole upload can be
  **backed out** later (`services/bulk_upload_reversal_service.py`). Backing out withdraws
  exceptions that haven't been decided yet, and never overrides a human decision.

## Authentication and sessions

- **Tokens:** JWTs signed with ECDSA (`auth/security.py`, keys from `auth/keys.py`): an
  access token (30 minutes by default) and a refresh token (7 days). A bank can override
  both. The payload carries user, tenant and membership, but permissions come from the
  membership's *current* security group on every request (`auth/deps.py`), so a change to
  a group or a deactivated membership takes effect on the next request.
- **Sessions:** in the UI, activity keeps the session alive, and the page warns 5 minutes
  before it would expire (`static/js/session.js`). Logging out ends that session. An admin
  "sign out everywhere", a password change and an admin password reset end all of a
  person's sessions (`services/session_service.py`, recorded in `revoked_session`, which
  every request checks).
- **Second factor:** WebAuthn (`auth/webauthn_service.py`). Challenges are stored in the
  database with a 5-minute lifetime. A registered key belongs to one bank
  (`webauthn_credential.tenant_id`), not to the person, so someone in two banks registers
  a key in each. That costs people in several banks a little extra setup, but a key
  registered at one bank never grants anything at another. A bank can require a key for a
  membership (`tenant_membership.require_webauthn`).
- **SSO:** OIDC per bank, or per customer (`auth/oidc_service.py`, `services/sso_service.py`).
  Login state and nonce travel in a signed, short-lived cookie. IdP groups map to security
  groups.
- **Outbound HTTP** (OIDC discovery and token calls) goes through `auth/outbound_http.py`,
  which refuses private, loopback and link-local addresses (including via DNS rebinding),
  so a bank admin can't point an SSO connection at internal services.

## Web UI vs. JSON API

The UI (`web/routers/`) calls the **service layer directly, in-process**. It never calls
its own JSON API over HTTP. That avoids a second network hop, a second copy of every
error-mapping path, and having to hold a bearer token in the browser. The two front ends
use separate credentials: the UI reads an HttpOnly `access_token` cookie
(`web/deps.py`), and the API reads the `Authorization` header (`auth/deps.py`). Neither
accepts the other's.

Because the UI uses cookies, every `/ui/*` POST carries a double-submit CSRF token
(`web/security.py`). Pages use a strict per-request nonce CSP, so there are no inline
scripts or styles. Templates hide buttons with `can(ctx, permission)`, but that's
cosmetic: the route's own permission check is what enforces access.

The WebAuthn login routes follow the same rule. The browser script
(`static/js/webauthn.js`) only handles the options and credential JSON, and never sees a
token.

## Data exports

A bank admin can export all of the bank's data; a customer admin can export their own
customer's data (`services/data_export_service.py`). Both produce a ZIP of JSON files
and images, built by a background task.

| Included | Bank-wide export | Customer export |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| Accounts, issued items, stops, paid items, ACH rules and transactions, exceptions, decisions, check images | ✓ | ✓ (that customer's only) |
| Users (email, active flag, security group **name**), SSO connections and group mappings | ✓ | ✓ (that customer's only) |
| Customers list, bulk upload files, audit log | ✓ | ✗ |

The last row is bank-wide only: those rows either can't be attributed to one customer, or
would reveal the bank's own configuration and activity to a customer's admin. Password
hashes and other secrets are never exported, and a final filter (`_SECRET_COLUMNS`) strips
them even if a future change adds them by mistake.

## Background work and multiple instances

Two kinds of background work:

- **Scheduled jobs** (`workers/tasks.py`, started by `workers/scheduler.py` when their
  `POSPAY_*` flags are on): ML retrain, dropbox import, notification sending, the
  expired-disposition sweep, and the demo tenant reset. On Postgres each run takes a
  per-job advisory lock (`workers/leader_lock.py`), so with several instances only one
  runs each tick. The jobs are plain functions, so an external cron can call them instead.
- **Request-triggered tasks** (FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`): OCR after an image upload, and
  data exports. They run in the process that took the request.

State that's per process: the rate limiter (`web/rate_limit.py`) and the OIDC discovery
and key caches. Files (images, exports, uploads, model artifacts) are on local disk
under paths from `config.py`. See README, "Running more than one instance", for what that
means for deployment.

## Known gaps

- **Historical check features** (issuer exception rate, amount z-score against the
  issuer's history, check-number gaps) were planned but aren't built. The check model
  uses per-item and OCR features only (`networks/check/features.py`).
- **Cloud OCR providers** are stubs (see [OCR](#ocr)).
- **X9.37 field positions** follow the published layouts but haven't been checked against
  a real processor's file (`bulk_import/x937.py`).
- **Postgres-specific features** (RLS, the scheduler lock) are covered by unit tests but
  haven't been run against a live Postgres server in this repo's CI.
