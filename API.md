# PosPay REST API

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. This is the JSON API surface — it exists
alongside (and, where equivalent, is backed by the same services as) the server-rendered
`/ui/*` web app, but the two are separate: the web app uses cookie sessions, the API
below uses JWT bearer tokens, and some web-only conveniences (file-upload bulk import)
have no API equivalent (see [Bulk uploads](#bulk-uploads)).

## Authentication

### Login

```
POST /api/v1/auth/login
```

Body (`LoginRequest`):

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant_slug` | string | which organization to log into |
| `email` | string | |
| `password` | string | |

Response (`LoginResponse`):

```json
{
  "mfa_required": false,
  "access_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "mfa_token": null,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

If the account has a registered WebAuthn credential, `mfa_required` is `true` and
`access_token`/`refresh_token` are withheld — only `mfa_token` is returned. `mfa_token`
carries no permissions and can only be used against the two `/auth/webauthn/login/*`
endpoints below to complete the second factor.

### Refresh

```
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

Body: `{"refresh_token": "..."}`. Returns a new `TokenResponse` (`access_token` +
`refresh_token`). The new tokens always reflect the membership's *current* security
group and active status — not whatever was true when the refresh token was issued — so a
permission change or deactivation takes effect the next time a client refreshes.

### Using the access token

Every other endpoint requires:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

A token encodes `tenant_id`, `security_group_id`, and (if the membership is
customer-scoped) `customer_id`. Permissions are **not** baked into the token — they're
re-resolved from the security group's current permission set on every request, so
editing a group or deactivating a user/membership takes effect immediately, without
waiting for the token to expire. See [Permissions](#permissions) below.

### WebAuthn / FIDO2 (second factor)

All under `/api/v1/auth/webauthn`, and (except the two `/login/*` endpoints) require a
normal access token:

| method | path | auth | purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/register/options` | access token | begin registering a new credential for the current user |
| POST | `/register/verify` | access token | complete registration; body: `{"credential": {...}, "nickname": "..."}` (raw `navigator.credentials.create()` response) → `201` + `WebauthnCredentialRead` |
| GET | `/credentials` | access token | list the current user's registered credentials |
| DELETE | `/credentials/{credential_id}` | access token | remove a credential → `204` |
| POST | `/login/options` | `mfa_token` | begin the second factor after a password check that returned `mfa_required: true` |
| POST | `/login/verify` | `mfa_token` | complete it; body: `{"credential": {...}}` (raw `navigator.credentials.get()` response) → `TokenResponse` with real access/refresh tokens |

`WebauthnCredentialRead`: `id`, `nickname`, `aaguid`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`.

## Permissions

Every endpoint below is gated on one permission key from this catalog, checked against
the caller's current security group. There is no per-user permission override — a
membership always has exactly one security group governing what it can do, plus an
optional customer scope governing whose data it can see (see
[Multi-tenancy and customer scoping](#multi-tenancy-and-customer-scoping)).

| permission | grants |
|---|---|
| `account:read` / `account:write` | view / create accounts |
| `issued_item:read` / `issued_item:write` | view / create & void issued items |
| `stop_payment:read` / `stop_payment:write` | view / create & cancel stop payments |
| `paid_item:read` / `paid_item:write` | view / submit paid items |
| `check_image:read` / `check_image:write` | view / upload & reprocess check images |
| `ach_authorization:read` / `ach_authorization:write` | view / create & revoke ACH authorizations |
| `ach_transaction:read` / `ach_transaction:write` | view / submit & bulk-load ACH transactions |
| `exception:read` | view exceptions |
| `exception:recommend` | submit a maker recommendation (pay/return) |
| `exception:decide` | finalize a pay/return decision (checker) |
| `admin:manage` | manage ML models and payment networks |
| `user:manage` | manage users (list, add, edit entitlements, deactivate) |
| `security_group:manage` | manage security groups |
| `tenant:manage` | manage organization branding/settings |
| `audit_log:read` | view the immutable action log |
| `customer:manage` | manage customers |

A missing permission returns `403 Forbidden` with `{"detail": "Missing permission: <key>"}`.

An expired token returns `401` with `"Token expired"`; any other invalid/malformed token,
or a token whose user/membership/security group has since been deactivated or deleted,
returns `401` with `"Invalid token"` — these are indistinguishable from the outside, by
design, so a token can't be used to probe why access was revoked.

## Multi-tenancy and customer scoping

A membership is either **bank-wide** (`customer_id` is `null` on the token — sees every
customer's data in the tenant) or **scoped to one customer** (`customer_id` set — every
list/get endpoint below transparently filters to that customer only, and creates are
rejected with `404` if they'd reference a different customer's account).

Customer-scoped tokens additionally have a fixed set of bank-staff permissions masked out
regardless of what their security group nominally grants: `user:manage`,
`security_group:manage`, `tenant:manage`, `customer:manage`, `admin:manage`,
`audit_log:read`. These are always bank-wide-only concerns.

## Resource endpoints

Every write endpoint (`POST`/`PATCH`) records an entry in the tenant's tamper-evident
audit log (`channel="api"`) — this is automatic and not a separate call you need to make.

### Issued items — `/api/v1/issued-items`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `issued_item:write` | body: `IssuedItemCreate` → `201` + `IssuedItemRead` |
| POST | `/bulk` | `issued_item:write` | body: JSON array of `IssuedItemCreate` → `BulkSubmitResponse` (see [Bulk uploads](#bulk-uploads)) |
| GET | `` | `issued_item:read` | query: `status_filter`, `account_id` |
| GET | `/outstanding` | `issued_item:read` | shortcut for `status_filter=outstanding` |
| GET | `/{item_id}` | `issued_item:read` | |
| PATCH | `/{item_id}/void` | `issued_item:write` | body: `{"reason": "..."}` |

`IssuedItemCreate`: `account_id`, `check_number`, `amount`, `payee_name`, `issue_date`.

`IssuedItemRead` adds: `id`, `status` (`outstanding` / `paid` / `voided` / `stopped` /
`stale`), `void_reason`, `created_at`.

### Stop payments — `/api/v1/stop-payments`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `stop_payment:write` | body: `StopPaymentCreate` → `201` + `StopPaymentRead` |
| GET | `` | `stop_payment:read` | query: `status_filter` |
| GET | `/outstanding` | `stop_payment:read` | shortcut for `status_filter=active` |
| PATCH | `/{stop_id}/cancel` | `stop_payment:write` | |

`StopPaymentCreate`: `account_id`, `check_number`, `amount` (optional), `effective_date`,
`expiration_date` (optional), `reason` (optional).

`StopPaymentRead` adds: `id`, `status` (`active` / `expired` / `cancelled`), `created_at`.

No bulk endpoint exists for stop payments.

### Paid items — `/api/v1/paid-items`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `paid_item:write` | body: `PaidItemCreate` → `201` + `PaidItemRead` |
| POST | `/bulk` | `paid_item:write` | body: JSON array of `PaidItemCreate` → `BulkSubmitResponse` |
| GET | `` | `paid_item:read` | query: `account_id` |
| GET | `/{item_id}` | `paid_item:read` | |

`PaidItemCreate`: `account_id`, `check_number`, `presented_amount`, `presented_date`.

`PaidItemRead` adds: `id`, `matched_issued_item_id`, `match_status` (`pending` /
`matched` / `exception`), `settlement_status` (`pending` / `paid` / `returned`),
`created_at`. Submitting a paid item automatically attempts to match it against an
outstanding issued item; a non-match becomes an exception item (see
[Exceptions and decisions](#exceptions-and-decisions)).

### Check images — `/api/v1/check-images`

The one multipart/file endpoint in the API.

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `check_image:write` | multipart form: `front_image` (required file), `back_image` (optional file), `paid_item_id` (optional query/form param) → `201` + `CheckImageRead` |
| GET | `/{check_image_id}` | `check_image:read` | |
| POST | `/{check_image_id}/reprocess` | `check_image:write` | resets `ocr_status` to `pending` and re-queues OCR |

`CheckImageRead`: `id`, `paid_item_id`, `ocr_status` (`pending` / `completed` /
`failed`), `ocr_extracted_amount`, `ocr_extracted_payee`, `ocr_confidence`,
`ocr_provider`, `created_at`, `processed_at`. OCR runs as a background task after the
request returns — poll `GET /{check_image_id}` until `ocr_status` is no longer `pending`.

### ACH authorizations — `/api/v1/ach/authorizations`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `ach_authorization:write` | body: `AchAuthorizationCreate` → `201` + `AchAuthorizationRead` |
| GET | `` | `ach_authorization:read` | query: `status_filter` |
| PATCH | `/{rule_id}/revoke` | `ach_authorization:write` | |

`AchAuthorizationCreate`: `account_id`, `originator_id`, `originator_name`, `receiver_id`
(optional — `null` means a blanket authorization for any receiver from this originator),
`max_amount` (optional), `frequency_limit` (optional), `allowed_sec_codes` (optional list
of strings), `effective_date`, `expiration_date` (optional).

`AchAuthorizationRead` adds: `id`, `status` (`active` / `revoked`), `created_at`.

No bulk endpoint exists for ACH authorizations.

### ACH transactions — `/api/v1/ach/transactions`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | `ach_transaction:write` | body: `AchTransactionCreate` → `201` + `AchTransactionRead` |
| POST | `/bulk` | `ach_transaction:write` | body: JSON array of `AchTransactionCreate` → `BulkSubmitResponse` |
| GET | `` | `ach_transaction:read` | query: `account_id` |
| GET | `/{transaction_id}` | `ach_transaction:read` | |

`AchTransactionCreate`: `account_id`, `originator_id`, `originator_name`, `receiver_id`
(optional), `amount`, `transaction_type` (`debit` / `credit`), `sec_code`,
`trace_number`, `effective_date`.

`AchTransactionRead` adds: `id`, `match_status` (`pending` / `matched` / `exception`),
`settlement_status` (`pending` / `paid` / `returned`), `created_at`. Matched against
active ACH authorizations the same way paid items are matched against issued items — a
non-match becomes an exception item.

### Exceptions and decisions — `/api/v1/exceptions`

Read-only inventory:

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | `exception:read` | query: `network_code`, `status_filter` |
| GET | `/{exception_id}` | `exception:read` | |

`ExceptionRead`: `id`, `network_code`, `source_item_id`, `related_reference_id`,
`exception_types` (list of strings), `status` (`open` / `pending_approval` / `pay` /
`return` / `escalated` / `withdrawn`), `ml_score` (optional), `ml_model_version`
(optional), `decision_deadline` (optional), `created_at`.

Maker/checker decisioning:

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/{exception_id}/recommend` | `exception:recommend` | maker's first pass — body: `RecommendRequest` |
| POST | `/{exception_id}/decide` | `exception:decide` | checker's final call — body: `DecideRequest` |
| GET | `/{exception_id}/decision` | `exception:read` | fetch the recorded decision, `404` if none yet |

Both `RecommendRequest` and `DecideRequest`: `outcome` (`pay` / `return`),
`reason_code`, `notes` (optional).

Error responses specific to decisioning (all `HTTPException` with a matching status):

| condition | status |
|---|---|
| exception not found | `404` |
| exception already has a final decision | `409` |
| `/decide` called before a recommendation exists | `409` |
| the same user who recommended tries to also decide (maker/checker segregation) | `403` |

`DecisionRead`: `id`, `exception_item_id`, `outcome`, `reason_code`, `notes`,
`submitted_by_user_id` (the maker, if any), `decided_by_user_id` (the checker),
`decided_at`.

### Admin — `/api/v1/admin`

All gated on `admin:manage`.

| method | path | notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/payment-networks` | list registered network codes (`list[str]`) |
| POST | `/ml/retrain?network_code=...` | retrain the fraud-scoring model for a network → `RetrainResponse`; `409` if there isn't enough training data yet |
| GET | `/ml/models` | list model versions; optional `?network_code=` filter |
| PATCH | `/ml/models/{model_id}/activate` | promote a trained model to active |

`MlModelRead`: `id`, `network_code`, `version`, `algorithm`,
`trained_from_decision_count`, `metrics_json`, `status` (`training` / `active` /
`retired` / `failed`), `activated_at`, `created_at`.

`RetrainResponse`: `network_code`, `promoted` (bool), `metrics` (`dict[str, float]`),
`model` (`MlModelRead`).

> ML models are global per network, not per-tenant (a deliberate design decision to solve
> cold-start scoring for new tenants) — `admin:manage` on any one tenant can currently
> retrain/activate a model that scores every tenant's exceptions. This is flagged as a
> gap for a real multi-tenant deployment, not something to route around.

### Users — `/api/v1/users`

| method | path | permission | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | `user:manage` | one row per membership — see below |

This is a read-only access-review / recertification endpoint: it runs the exact same
query as the `/ui/users` web page, so the two can never drift apart. There is currently
no API for creating, editing, or deactivating users/memberships — those actions are
web-UI-only (`/ui/users/*`).

`TenantUserRead`: `user_id`, `email`, `security_group_name`, `customer_name` (`null` =
bank-wide), `is_active` (the *membership's* status, not the underlying login's — the same
login can be active in one tenant and deactivated in another), `membership_id`,
`membership_created_at`, `last_login_at` (`null` if this identity has never completed a
login).

## Bulk uploads

`POST .../bulk` exists for **issued items, ACH transactions, and paid items** — each
takes a plain JSON array of the same `Create` schema used by the single-item `POST`,
and returns:

```json
{
  "total": 3,
  "succeeded": 2,
  "failed": 1,
  "results": [
    {"index": 0, "success": true, "id": "...", "status": null, "error": null},
    {"index": 1, "success": true, "id": "...", "status": "matched", "error": null},
    {"index": 2, "success": false, "id": null, "status": null, "error": "Account not found"}
  ]
}
```

Rows are processed independently — one bad row doesn't fail the whole batch, and
`results[i].index` maps each result back to its position in the request array.

**This is not a file-upload API.** The `/ui/*/bulk` web routes (CSV/file upload for
issued items, ACH transactions, paid items, *and* users) parse a file into rows and then
call the same underlying bulk-ingestion service — but there is no equivalent
`multipart/form-data` file-upload endpoint under `/api/v1`. A client integrating via the
API must already have parsed its data into a JSON array before calling `/bulk`.

There is no `/bulk` endpoint for stop payments, ACH authorizations, or check images.
