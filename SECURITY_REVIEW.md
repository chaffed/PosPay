# Security Review: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

Date: 2026-07-28
Scope: all features shipped to date (multi-tenant/customer core, auth + federated SSO +
WebAuthn, users/security groups/Bookkeeper access, accounts, issued items/stop
payments/paid items/check images, ACH, exceptions/decisions, ML scoring, bulk import,
data export, audit log, background workers).

This is an evaluation, not a fix list — findings are ordered most-severe-first within
each section, with file references so each can be independently verified. A "what's
solid" note closes out each section; those are deliberate design choices worth keeping,
not gaps.

## Confidentiality

**FIXED — hardcoded secrets silently used as production defaults.**
The three signing secrets (`jwt_secret_key`, `file_signing_secret`,
`audit_log_signing_secret`) are now ECDSA P-256 key pairs, generated per-deployment via
`scripts/generate_keys.py` (see README.md's "Signing keys" section), not shared secret
strings — the checked-in `dev_keys/` pair is deliberately public and only usable
locally. `config.py::assert_production_safe`, called at the top of
`main.py::create_app()`, now refuses to start the app at all if
`POSPAY_ENVIRONMENT=production` and any of the three key pairs (or `sso_encryption_key`,
which stays a symmetric secret since it's encryption, not signing) are still at their
checked-in/default values — verified by hand: the app raises `RuntimeError` and exits
immediately rather than serving requests insecurely.

**FIXED — check images aren't customer-scoped.**
`CheckImage` and `BulkUploadFile` now both have a `customer_id` column
(`CustomerScopedRepository`, same pattern as accounts/issued items/paid items/ACH), set
from the resolved account/paid item at creation time (check images) or the uploader's
own scope (bulk upload files). Fixed across both the web UI and the JSON API — the API's
`check-images` upload route had the same gap plus a pre-existing bug (`paid_item_id` was
declared as a bare query param even though the route only accepts multipart form data,
so it was silently ignored; now `Form(None)`). Verified end-to-end: a customer-scoped
user gets 404 on every check-image and bulk-upload-file route for another customer's
records; a customer-scoped data export now correctly includes its own check images
(including ones not yet linked to a paid item, which the old join-through-paid-item
workaround missed) and never another customer's.

~~High — bulk-uploaded source files have the identical gap.~~ — **done**, see above.

**High — the "global" ML model pools every tenant's decision data.**
No `tenant_id` filter anywhere in `ml/train.py`, `ml/registry.py`, or `workers/tasks.py`;
`MlModel` has no `tenant_id` column at all. Worse, raw `tenant_id` is embedded as a
literal training feature (`networks/check/features.py:49`, `networks/ach/features.py:20`)
and surfaces via `feature_importance()` — a coefficient dump reveals which tenants exist
and how they correlate with pay/return outcomes. This was a deliberate architecture
choice, not an oversight — `api/v1/admin.py:21-26` documents it as intentional (solving
the cold-start problem for a brand-new tenant with too little of its own decision
history) and explicitly flags it as needing a real fix — restricting these endpoints to
a platform-level role, not per-tenant `admin:manage` — before real multi-tenant
production use. It's an open IOU, not a hidden bug, but it's still open.

**FIXED — no login rate limiting or account lockout anywhere.**
`User` (`domain/user.py`) now carries `failed_login_attempts`/`locked_until`.
`auth/login_service.py::authenticate_password` increments the counter on each wrong
password for a known, active account and locks it (`login_max_failed_attempts` = 5,
`login_lockout_minutes` = 15, both configurable in `config.py`) once the threshold is
reached, returning a new `LOCKED` outcome that both the web login form and the JSON API
(`423 Locked`) surface distinctly from an ordinary wrong-password rejection — including
rejecting the *correct* password while locked, so an attacker's Nth guess landing can't
bypass the lock. The counter resets to zero the moment a password verifies correctly,
regardless of what happens afterward (e.g. an SSO-required scope). Throttling is
account-only (by email), not IP-based, as a brute force targets the password regardless
of source address. An admin can also manually clear a lockout early
(`services/user_service.py::unlock_user`, exposed as an "Unlock" button on the Users
page) rather than only waiting out the auto-expiry. Verified with unit tests
(`tests/test_auth/test_login_service.py`), web/API integration tests asserting the 401
lockout message and 423 status respectively, and an end-to-end smoke test (5 failed
attempts → lock → correct password still rejected → admin unlock → login succeeds again).

**FIXED — no bank-configurable session timeout.**
`Tenant` gained nullable `access_token_expire_minutes`/`refresh_token_expire_minutes`
columns (`None` = use the platform default from `config.py`). Every one of `create_token`'s
8 call sites across web and API login/refresh/switch-tenant/WebAuthn flows now threads the
resolved tenant through to `auth/security.py::create_token`, which honors the override for
the matching token type (the short-lived `mfa_pending` token is deliberately exempt — a
bank lengthening session lifetime shouldn't also lengthen how long a WebAuthn ceremony has
to complete). A new "Session timeout" form on the organization settings page
(`/ui/settings/session-timeout`) lets a tenant admin set or clear both values; blank means
"use the platform default." Verified with a unit test on `create_token`'s override
behavior and a web integration test confirming the issued access token's `exp` claim
reflects the configured value end-to-end.

**FIXED — CSV formula injection.**
A broader audit (two parallel investigations plus direct verification) found the actual
surface was much narrower than the original wording implied: OCR is a library call, never
a shell string (no command-injection path); every OCR-derived field only ever reaches
JSON, never CSV; and exactly one CSV writer exists in the whole app —
`/ui/users/export.csv`. That one now runs every cell through `_csv_safe()`, prefixing a
literal `'` on any value starting with `=`/`+`/`-`/`@` (the standard Excel/Sheets
"force text" mitigation) — `export_users_json`'s data is deliberately untouched, since
JSON isn't opened in a spreadsheet. Two related findings surfaced during the same audit
and fixed alongside it:
- `bulk_import/file_storage.py::save_uploaded_file` embedded the raw client-supplied
  filename in the on-disk path with no sanitization — reproduced directly that a
  traversal-shaped filename didn't currently escape the storage directory (pathlib's
  `write_bytes` doesn't auto-create missing parent directories, so it just crashed with
  an unhandled 500), but that was accidental, not a real control. Now sanitized with
  `Path(filename).name`.
- `bulk_import/images.py::normalize_and_split_image` didn't catch
  `Image.DecompressionBombError` — Pillow's own default decompression-bomb guard was
  already active (never disabled anywhere in this repo) but surfaced as a raw exception
  instead of this module's clean per-row error.

**FIXED — data export's secret exclusion was fragile.**
The generic row exporter (`_row_to_dict`) correctly strips `hashed_password`/
`client_secret_encrypted` for every exporter that uses it. Re-verified while fixing this:
`_sso_group_mapping_dicts` was actually already safe — it does call `_row_to_dict` per
row — so the original wording naming it alongside `_users_dicts` was inaccurate; only
`_users_dicts` hand-composes its dict without going through the shared filter. It's now
run through the same exclusion set as a mechanical safety net (it didn't emit either
secret field before this either, but nothing structurally prevented a future edit from
reintroducing one). More importantly, a new test walks a fully-populated tenant-wide
export's entire archive — every entity, not just users/SSO — and asserts no
`_SECRET_COLUMNS` name appears anywhere, as a tripwire against any *future* exporter
leaking a secret column, which is the real fix for "correct only because someone
remembered by hand."

**What's genuinely solid:** permissions are re-resolved from the DB on every request
rather than baked into the JWT, so revoking a membership or editing a group takes effect
immediately; passwords are bcrypt-hashed; SSO client secrets are Fernet-encrypted at rest
under a key separate from the JWT signing key; cookies are httponly/secure/samesite with
narrow path scoping for refresh and MFA cookies; CSRF uses a constant-time double-submit
check; `next` redirects are validated against open-redirect; and the Bookkeeper/
cross-tenant tooling was deliberately built to never leak one tenant's access into
another admin's view.

## Integrity

**Accepted — dual control defaults to off.**
`Tenant.require_dual_control` defaults to `False` for every new tenant, so unless a bank
explicitly opts in, one person holding both `exception:recommend` and `exception:decide`
(Admin, or the new Bookkeeper preset) can unilaterally finalize a pay/return decision with
no second reviewer. Reviewed and accepted as the correct default, not a gap: dual control
isn't the common case for positive pay, though some banks do request it — which is exactly
why it's a per-tenant opt-in (`/ui/settings` → "Require dual control") rather than mandatory.

**FIXED — `activate_model()` has no ownership check.**
`activate_model` now takes a required, keyword-only `expected_customer_id` and rejects
(with the same "not found" message as an unknown model_id, so it doesn't reveal that a
mismatched model exists) any model whose own `customer_id` doesn't match — closing the
web bank-wide route, the web per-customer route, the API route, and `train_model`'s own
internal promotion call. Verified: a customer-scoped model can no longer be activated via
the bank-wide route or a different customer's page, only via its own.

**FIXED — NACHA/X9.37 control totals are not validated.**
`nacha.py` now cross-checks batch control (type 8) and file control (type 9) records'
declared entry/addenda count, entry hash, and total debit/credit dollar amounts against
what was actually parsed, raising a clear per-field mismatch error. `x937.py` does the
same for Cash Letter Control (type 90) and File Control (type 99) item count and total
dollar amount — Bundle Control (type 70) is still not validated, since PosPay doesn't
track bundle boundaries as a concept at all. X9.37's control-record field positions are
this module's own best-effort, documented convention (same caveat its test suite already
disclosed for the rest of the parser) — there's no real sample cash-letter file in this
repo to verify byte-for-byte against, so if a real file from your processor gets rejected
on a mismatch that looks wrong, check those positions first.

**Low — `joblib.load` (pickle) deserializes model artifacts with no signature check** —
not attacker-reachable today since the path comes from the DB, but no defense-in-depth if
that ever changes.

**What's genuinely solid:** the audit log is a real hash chain (ECDSA P-256 signature over
canonical fields including `prev_entry_hash`, since the key-pair signing change above),
with a `verify_chain` endpoint that detects tampering; there's no delete/purge path for
audit rows at the app layer; bulk-upload reversal is idempotent and checks current record
state before voiding (won't undo something already paid); WebAuthn has clone-detection
via sign-count regression.

## Availability

**FIXED — no request/file size limits anywhere.**
A new middleware (`main.py`) rejects any request whose `Content-Length` exceeds
`max_request_body_bytes` (default 50MB) with a 413, before any route or parser ever sees
the body — covers tabular/NACHA/X937 uploads uniformly with one change. Doesn't catch a
chunked-transfer-encoded request that omits `Content-Length`; not adding a full streaming
body-size enforcer for that, a deliberate proportionality call. `zip_import.py` separately
sums every entry's own declared uncompressed size before reading any of them, rejecting
if the total exceeds `max_zip_uncompressed_bytes` (default 200MB) — the zip-bomb-specific
case the request-size check structurally can't catch. OCR calls now also pass a
30-second timeout (`ocr_timeout_seconds`), closing off a pathological image hanging a
background-task slot indefinitely.

**FIXED — ML retrain endpoints have no rate limit or lock.**
`train_model` now rejects a retrain of the same `(network_code, customer_id)` pair within
`ml_retrain_cooldown_seconds` (default 60) of the last one, checked before loading any
data — one choke point covering the web routes, the API route, and the background job
alike, closing the on-demand-hammering vector.

**FIXED — the background retrain job has no persistent queue.**
Kept as a deliberate scope decision (a real job queue is a separate, bigger
infrastructure question), but `retrain_job()`'s two loops now go through a shared
`_train_and_log` helper that catches any unexpected exception (not just the
already-handled "not enough data yet" case), rolls back cleanly, records a `FAILED`
`MlModel` row (visible on the admin models page — `MlModelStatus.FAILED` existed in the
enum but was never actually written before this), and moves on to the next
network/customer instead of aborting the rest of the run.

**FIXED — data export archives had no row limit, pagination, or timeout.**
`_build_archive` (`services/data_export_service.py`) now checks a time budget
(`config.py::data_export_timeout_seconds`, default 5 minutes, overridable per-tenant via
a new "Data export timeout" field on `/ui/settings`) before starting each named entity's
export and before each check-image/bulk-upload-file copy, failing the job clearly
(`ExportTimedOut`) rather than letting it hang indefinitely. Separately, any single
entity whose row count exceeds `data_export_max_rows_per_entity` (default 50,000, a
global technical ceiling, not a per-tenant policy value) fails the job with a clear
message (`ExportRowLimitExceeded`) before its JSON is ever written into the archive.
This is a deliberately proportional fix, not a full streaming/paginated rewrite of every
repository: the check is cooperative, between units of work, so a single entity whose own
query is itself slow isn't interrupted mid-query — same "sum sizes before reading" spirit
as `bulk_import/zip_import.py`'s existing zip-bomb guard, matched to this finding's
Low/Low-Medium severity. Both new exceptions are caught by `run_export_job`'s existing
broad exception handler, which already marks the job `FAILED` with a clear message — no
new failure-handling path was needed.

**What's genuinely solid:** every bulk-import path commits per-row, so one bad row can't
abort or corrupt the rest of a file; OCR and export background tasks are wrapped in broad
exception handlers that mark the job FAILED rather than hang.

## If you want to fix three things first

1. ~~Fail loudly on startup if any of the four secrets are still at their dev default
   outside a local/test environment~~ — **done**: key-pair signing + `assert_production_safe`.
2. **Add `customer_id` scoping to check images and bulk-upload-file downloads** —
   straightforward, same pattern already used everywhere else, closes a real disclosure
   that requires no misconfiguration to exploit.
3. **Tenant-scope the ML training/activation pipeline** (or explicitly restrict it to a
   platform-level role, as the existing code comment suggests) — already flagged by the
   code itself, just not yet acted on.
